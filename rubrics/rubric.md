# Summary Writing Evaluation Rubric

## Grades 6–8 Informational Text Summaries

---

## Overview

This rubric evaluates student summaries of informational texts across four key dimensions. Each dimension is scored on a 5-point scale with specific behavioral anchors defining performance at each level. The rubric is designed for middle school students (grades 6–8) and aligns with Common Core State Standards for summary writing.

## Scoring Dimensions

- **Completeness (1–5):** Coverage of main ideas and essential supporting details from the source text
- **Accuracy (1–5):** Factual correctness with no distortions or misrepresentations of source content
- **Coherence (1–5):** Logical organization, smooth transitions, and precise sentence-to-sentence flow
- **Conciseness (1–5):** Appropriate length with no unnecessary repetition or irrelevant information

## Dimension 1: Completeness

**Definition:** The extent to which the summary captures all essential main ideas and key supporting details from the source text.

| Score | Completeness Descriptors |
|:-----:|--------------------------|
| **5** | **Comprehensive and Complete**<br>• Includes ALL main ideas from the source text with no omissions<br>• Incorporates essential supporting details that clarify or illustrate each main point<br>• Maintains appropriate balance—no main idea is over-emphasized or under-represented<br>• Demonstrates thorough understanding of the text's scope and purpose |
| **4** | **Nearly Complete**<br>• Includes most main ideas with only minor omissions that don't significantly affect overall understanding<br>• Provides key supporting details for most main points<br>• May briefly under-represent one secondary idea, but covers all primary concepts<br>• Demonstrates a strong grasp of the text's central content |
| **3** | **Partial Coverage**<br>• Includes several main ideas but omits at least one crucial concept<br>• Provides some supporting details, but coverage is inconsistent across ideas<br>• May focus heavily on one section while neglecting others<br>• Demonstrates basic understanding but misses notable aspects of the text |
| **2** | **Limited Coverage**<br>• Identifies only a few main ideas, missing multiple important concepts<br>• Provides minimal or no supporting details<br>• May focus on minor points while missing major themes<br>• Shows superficial or incomplete understanding of the text |
| **1** | **Minimal or No Coverage**<br>• Fails to identify main ideas or includes only one very general statement<br>• Provides no meaningful supporting details<br>• May restate the title or provide only tangentially related information<br>• Demonstrates little to no understanding of the text's content |

---

## Dimension 2: Accuracy

**Definition:** The degree to which the summary represents source content truthfully, without factual errors, distortions, or misinterpretations.

| Score | Accuracy Descriptors |
|:-----:|----------------------|
| **5** | **Fully Accurate**<br>• All information is factually correct and faithfully represents the source<br>• Uses precise language that maintains the author's intended meaning<br>• Contains no distortions, exaggerations, or misinterpretations<br>• Appropriately paraphrases without changing meaning or introducing errors |
| **4** | **Mostly Accurate**<br>• Information is generally accurate with only very minor imprecisions<br>• Any slight inaccuracies do not substantially alter the meaning<br>• Paraphrasing is generally effective and preserves intended meaning<br>• May contain minor wording that could be more precise but is not misleading |
| **3** | **Partially Accurate**<br>• Contains several accurate points but also noticeable inaccuracies<br>• May misinterpret or oversimplify one or more concepts<br>• Paraphrasing sometimes changes the intended meaning<br>• Errors are present but don't completely distort the overall message |
| **2** | **Largely Inaccurate**<br>• Contains multiple significant factual errors or distortions<br>• Misrepresents key concepts or the author's main arguments<br>• May confuse cause and effect, mix up details, or attribute ideas incorrectly<br>• Paraphrasing frequently alters meaning or introduces confusion |
| **1** | **Severely Inaccurate**<br>• Presents information that directly contradicts the source<br>• Includes fabricated details not found in the original text<br>• Fundamentally misunderstands or misrepresents the text's content<br>• Creates a misleading or false impression of what the source actually says |

---

## Dimension 3: Coherence

**Definition:** The clarity of organization, logical flow of ideas, and effectiveness of transitions that connect sentences and concepts.

| Score | Coherence Descriptors |
|:-----:|-----------------------|
| **5** | **Highly Coherent**<br>• Ideas flow logically with clear, purposeful organization<br>• Uses effective transitions that explicitly connect concepts and guide the reader<br>• Each sentence builds naturally on the previous one<br>• Organization enhances understanding by presenting information in a logical sequence |
| **4** | **Generally Coherent**<br>• Ideas are clearly organized with logical progression<br>• Uses transitions effectively in most places, though a few may be basic or implicit<br>• One or two minor organizational choices could be smoother, but don't disrupt understanding<br>• Overall structure supports comprehension |
| **3** | **Somewhat Coherent**<br>• Basic organization is present, but logical flow is inconsistent<br>• Transitions are missing or ineffective in several places<br>• Some ideas seem disconnected or presented in an awkward sequence<br>• The reader may need to reread to follow the connections between ideas |
| **2** | **Largely Incoherent**<br>• Organization is unclear, or ideas jump between topics<br>• Few or no transitions connect sentences<br>• Sentences may appear random or in an illogical order<br>• Reader struggles to understand the relationships between ideas |
| **1** | **Incoherent**<br>• No discernible organization or logical structure<br>• Ideas are presented as disconnected fragments<br>• Completely lacks transitions or connecting language<br>• Writing is confusing and challenging to follow, even with careful reading |

---

## Dimension 4: Conciseness

**Definition:** The efficiency of expression—including only essential information without unnecessary repetition, wordiness, or irrelevant details.

| Score | Conciseness Descriptors |
|:-----:|-------------------------|
| **5** | **Highly Concise**<br>• Every sentence contributes essential information<br>• Language is efficient and precise with no unnecessary words<br>• Contains no repetition or redundancy<br>• Stays focused on main ideas without irrelevant details or tangents |
| **4** | **Generally Concise**<br>• Most sentences contribute meaningful information<br>• Language is mostly efficient with only minor wordiness<br>• May contain very brief repetition that doesn't significantly detract<br>• Stays focused with only one or two minor irrelevant details |
| **3** | **Somewhat Concise**<br>• Includes necessary information but with noticeable wordiness<br>• Contains repetition of ideas or details that could be stated once<br>• Includes some irrelevant information or unnecessary examples<br>• Could be notably shortened without losing essential content |
| **2** | **Not Concise**<br>• Contains significant wordiness and unnecessary elaboration<br>• Frequently repeats the same ideas in different words<br>• Includes multiple irrelevant details or examples<br>• Could be reduced substantially (by half or more) without losing meaning |
| **1** | **Excessively Wordy**<br>• Overwhelmingly wordy with excessive, redundant language<br>• Repeats ideas multiple times without adding new information<br>• Filled with tangential information unrelated to the source text<br>• Essential content is buried in excessive verbiage |

## Using This Rubric

### Scoring Guidelines

- **Score each dimension independently.** A summary may score differently across dimensions—for example, a response might be highly complete (5) but somewhat incoherent (3).

- **When a summary falls between two levels,** consider which description matches more characteristics. If genuinely halfway between levels, assign the lower score to maintain conservative standards.

- **Focus on what is present** in the student's writing rather than imagining what could have been written—score based on demonstrated performance.

### Calibration Process

Before scoring the validation dataset, complete the following calibration steps:

1. Study this rubric thoroughly, paying special attention to the distinguishing features between adjacent score levels (e.g., what separates a 4 from a 5).

2. Review Common Core State Standards for summary writing in grades 6–8 to understand developmental expectations.

3. Analyze exemplar summaries representing different quality levels, noting how they exemplify each rubric dimension.

4. Score 10–15 practice summaries and compare your ratings to benchmark scores, analyzing discrepancies to refine your interpretation of criteria.

### Common Scoring Challenges

- **Completeness vs. Conciseness:** A complete summary includes all main ideas but remains concise. Including unnecessary details or repetition lowers the Conciseness score but doesn't necessarily improve Completeness.

- **Accuracy vs. Completeness:** A summary can be accurate in what it includes but incomplete in coverage. Evaluate these dimensions separately.

- **Coherence vs. Grammar:** Coherence focuses on logical organization and transitions, not grammatical correctness. A summary with minor grammatical errors can still be highly coherent if ideas flow logically.

### Documentation Requirements

For each summary scored, document:

- Summary identifier
- Score for each dimension (Completeness, Accuracy, Coherence, Conciseness)
- Brief rationale for borderline cases or scores requiring particular judgment
- Confidence level (high/medium/low) for difficult summaries
- Date and time of scoring

*This systematic documentation enables analysis of scoring patterns and supports calculation of test-retest reliability.*
